### **Flagship Product: SynapseBand™**

The SynapseBand is a wearable, non-invasive neural headband that detects and decodes neural activity in real time. It leverages multi-sensor arrays and NeuroLink’s proprietary NeuralNet Engine™ to translate thought patterns into actionable digital commands.

**Key Features:**

* Sensor array: 128-channel dry EEG with adaptive calibration
* Latency: <15 ms brain-to-command response time
* AI interpretation: Deep-learning–based decoding for motor, cognitive, and emotional states
* Battery life: 22 hours continuous operation
* Connectivity: Secure 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and BLE integration
* Compatibility: Works across iOS, Android, Windows, and VR/AR ecosystems
